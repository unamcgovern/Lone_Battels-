                  This dashboard, designed with the intent of shedding light on the silent plight of children
                  facing hardships, revolves around a central theme: <span class="text-blue">The percentage of children
                     with exactly
                     one deprivation.</span>

               <p>
                  UNICEF defines child deprivations as conditions that deny children access to basic human
                  rights and necessities, such as <span class="text-blue">education, nutrition, water, sanitation,
                     shelter, and health.</span>
               </p>
               <p>
                  A child suffering from exactly one deprivation faces significant challenges that could affect
                  their development, education, and future potential.

               <h3>Iraq</h3>
               <p>Iraq has the highest percentage of children suffering from exactly one deprivation, several factors
                  contirbute
                  to this distinction including the eyars of conflict, political instability, economic challenges and
                  displacement.</p>
               <p>
                  These conditions have severely impacted infrastructure, access to basic sercices, and the overall
                  quality of
                  life, palcing children at a higher risk of experiencing deprivation.
                  The lack of stable education and helath facilities, couples with inadequate water and sanitation
                  systems.</p>

               <h3>Conclusion</h3>
               <p>This dashboard not only serves as a tool for awareness but also as a call to action.
                  By visualising the data on child deprivation, it underscores the importance of targeted
                  interventions, international cooperation, and sustainable development efforts to address
                  the root causes of these deprivations.

                  This story invites policymakers and the global community to reflect on the the well-being of
                  children worldwide, urging a collective response to ensure every child has the opportunity
                  to thrive.</p>
